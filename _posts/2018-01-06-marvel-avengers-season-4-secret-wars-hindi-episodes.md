The Avengersâ€™ plans to bring Tony Stark back from another dimension experience a major setback when a new version of the Cabal (consisting of [Leader](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_(comics) "Leader (comics)"), [Arnim Zola](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnim_Zola "Arnim Zola"), [Enchantress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enchantress_(Marvel_Comics) "Enchantress (Marvel Comics)"), [Executioner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executioner_(comics) "Executioner (comics)"), and [Kang the Conqueror](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kang_the_Conqueror "Kang the Conqueror")) is formed, with Leader planning to use his Static Expander device on the captive Avengers. Black Panther forms the [New Avengers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Avengers_(comics) "The New Avengers (comics)") to rescue them which consists of Ant-Man, Captain Marvel, Ms. Marvel, Vision, and [Wasp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Pym "Hope Pym"). Even though Leader is defeated, Enchantress and Arnim Zola reveal that Leader is not the true leader of the Cabal as they activate the fail-safe that activates the Static Expander to scatter the captive Avengers across time and space.
