Told in three interconnected segments, we follow a young man named Takaki through his life as cruel winters, cold technology, and finally, adult obligations and responsibility converge to test the delicate petals of love.

**Episode 1 – Cherry Blossom**  
Takaki Tōno quickly befriends Akari Shinohara when she transfers to his elementary school in [Tokyo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo "Tokyo"). They grow closer to each other due to similar interests and attitudes; for instance, they both prefer to stay inside during recess due to their seasonal allergies. As a result, they form a strong bond; they speak to each other using their given names without any form of honorifics, which is a sign of deep friendship and familiarity in Japan.

**Episode 2 – Cosmonaut**  
In 1999, Takaki is now in the third year of [senior high](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Japan#School_grades "Education in Japan") in [Tanegashima](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanegashima "Tanegashima"), where the [Tanegashima Space Center](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanegashima_Space_Center "Tanegashima Space Center") is located. Kanae Sumida, a classmate of Takaki, has been in love with him ever since meeting him in middle school but has never had the courage to confess her feelings. She tries to spend time with him, waiting long after school for the chance to travel home together. However, Takaki appears ignorant to Kanae’s feelings and only treats her as a good friend.

**Episode 3 – 5 Centimeters per Second (Series Finale)**  
It is 2008. Takaki is now a programmer in Tokyo. Meanwhile, Akari is preparing to get married to another man. Takaki still longs for Akari to the detriment of his lifestyle. He receives a call from his current girlfriend but does not answer, signifying the relationship’s end. Depressed, Takaki quits his job, unable to cope with his feelings for Akari. Akari goes through a box of her old possessions and finds the letter she had written to Takaki many years ago. Takaki finds himself in a convenience store reading a magazine about the rocket launched in Episode 2: Cosmonaut. Takaki and Akari begin a dual narration, both recalling a recent dream. In this dream, they relive their last meeting in the snow-filled Iwafune, and remember the wish to someday watch the [cherry blossoms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_blossom "Cherry blossom") together again.
