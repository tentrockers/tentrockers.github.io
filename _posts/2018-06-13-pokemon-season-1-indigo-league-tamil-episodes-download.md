“Indigo League” is where it all began as the first season of the long-running “Pokémon” animated series. Young Ash Ketchum is just beginning his Pokémon training as he reaches his 10th birthday. Things don’t go as expected for the youngster, who gets a Pikachu instead of a standard first Pokémon. Winning gym badges is also tougher than Ash thought it would be. He’s not alone in his quest for the badges, though, as former gym leaders Brock and Misty are by his side, along with some new friends.

### Pokémon: Indigo League

Number of Seasons: 1 (82 episodes, 80 broadcast in America, 78 regularly broadcast)

Time Requirements: If you watch only the episodes that are Episodes available in the US, it takes a little under 30 hours. That makes it possible to cover in a month only watching an hour (three episodes) per day. Or if you feel like a marathon, watch four hours every day and get caught up in a week!

Where to Get Your Fix: Netflix currently has 52 episodes from _Indigo League_, just over half the first installment of the series, but it’s a little more difficult to track down the back end of the season. But they are available for purchase on Amazon, Google Play, and other services.

Best Character to Follow:

Ash and Pikachu. The emotional through line of the series is the “boy and his dog” bonding between Ash Ketchum and his fiercely loyal Pikachu. The electric mouse is an incredibly expressive character, who functions as Ash’s signature battle participant. But since Pikachu rejects the typical captured Pokémon travel method of living inside a Pokeball, he’s out and about to interact with Misty, Brock, and anyone else the trio encounters. The evolving relationship between Ash and Pikachu tracks how the two learn to play off one another, read opponents, and solve problems in order to get Ash and his friends through the various narrative obstacles in their way. There’s a reason Pikachu has become the de facto mascot of Pokémon, the most in-demand creature for _Pokémon Go_ players to capture.

Seasons/Episodes You Can Skip:

There are four episodes produced for _Indigo League_ that aren’t in regular rotation when the series airs. A couple episodes were deemed controversial in Japan and were never dubbed into English, and another couple aired once before being removed from the rotation. They’re not essential, and they’re easy to track down for those with completist tendencies, but we’ll detail them here so you can get the gist of them without missing out.
