Doraemon the Movie: Nobita and the Green Giant Legend\[a\], also known as Doraemon, Nobita and the Green Planet,\[2\] is an anime feature film that was released in Japan on 8 March 2008. It’s the 28th Doraemon film.

The plot is based on the story in Doraemon manga volume 26 “Forest is living” and in volume 33 “Goodbye Ki-bō”. This movie is not a remake, however, Ki-bō has appeared already in the 1992 film, Nobita and the Kingdom of Clouds. The name Ki-bō comes from the words “Ki” (木) meaning tree, and “Bō” (坊) meaning boy. The word Ki-bō also comes from the word “Kibō” (希望), which means hope. The catch phrase of this movie is “僕らの希望が未来を動かす” (our hope moves the future), which Ki-bō’s name can be referred to. Voices of Roku-chan and Moya-kun were done by anonymous children who were chosen.) .

The film was illustrated as manga in the February and March edition of CoroCoro Comic. Then it was released as the 25th film tankōbon. An action-adventure game was also released on March 6, 2008, two days before the release of the film, entitled, Nobita and the Green Giant Legend DS\[b\]. This movie was ranked the 8th highest grossing Japanese animated movie.
