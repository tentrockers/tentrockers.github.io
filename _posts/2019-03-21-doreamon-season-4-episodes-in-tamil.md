_**Doraemon**_ ([Japanese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language "Japanese language"): ドラえもん) is a Japanese [manga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga "Manga") series written and illustrated by [Fujiko F. Fujio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujiko_F._Fujio "Fujiko F. Fujio"), the pen name of the duo Hiroshi Fujimoto and Motoo Abiko. The series has also been adapted into a successful [anime](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime "Anime") series and [media franchise](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_franchise "Media franchise"). The story revolves around a robotic cat named [Doraemon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doraemon_(character) "Doraemon (character)"), who [travels back in time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel "Time travel") from the 21st century to aid a boy named [Nobita Nobi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobita_Nobi "Nobita Nobi")(野比のび太 _Nobi Nobita_).The Doraemon manga series was first published in December 1969 in six different magazines. A total of 1,345 stories were created in the original series, which are published by [Shogakukan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogakukan "Shogakukan"). It is [one of the best-selling manga in the world](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_manga "List of best-selling manga"), having sold over 100 million copies as of 2015.

The volumes are collected in the Takaoka Central Library in [Toyama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyama_Prefecture "Toyama Prefecture"), Japan, where Fujiko Fujio was born. [Turner Broadcasting System](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System "Turner Broadcasting System") bought the rights to the Doraemon anime series in the mid-1980s for an English-language release in the United States,[\[3\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doraemon#cite_note-3) but cancelled it without explanation before broadcasting any episodes. In July 2013, [Voyager Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Books "Voyager Books") announced the manga would be released digitally in English via the [Amazon Kindle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle "Amazon Kindle") [e-book](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-book "E-book") service.

Awards for Doraemon include the [Japan Cartoonists Association Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Cartoonists_Association_Award "Japan Cartoonists Association Award") for excellence in 1973, the first [Shogakukan Manga Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogakukan_Manga_Award "Shogakukan Manga Award")for [children’s manga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children{8cd00c2b6371b4e82b2136421417e8ecb96b705ea6eb9720573582fbfe11734e}27s_anime_and_manga "Children's anime and manga") in 1982, and the first [Osamu Tezuka Culture Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osamu_Tezuka_Culture_Award "Osamu Tezuka Culture Award") in 1997. In March 2008, [Japan’s Foreign Ministry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Japan) "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)")appointed Doraemon as the nation’s first “anime ambassador.” A Ministry spokesperson explained the novel decision as an attempt to help people in other countries understand Japanese anime better and to deepen their interest in [Japanese culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_culture "Japanese culture").[\[4\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doraemon#cite_note-4)

The Foreign Ministry action confirms that Doraemon has come to be considered a Japanese cultural icon. [In India](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doraemon_in_India "Doraemon in India"), its [Hindi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi "Hindi"), [Telugu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language "Telugu language") and [Tamil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language "Tamil language") translation has been telecasted, where the anime version is the highest-rated kids’ show; winning the _Best Show For Kids_ award twice at the [Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards India](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickelodeon_Kids{8cd00c2b6371b4e82b2136421417e8ecb96b705ea6eb9720573582fbfe11734e}27_Choice_Awards_India "Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards India") in 2013 and 2015.
