Inventor Howard Stark seemingly dies in a plane crash while investigating an ancient Chinese “Makluan ring”. His son, Tony Stark, barely survives the crash when the armored exoskeleton-battle suit which Tony designed and built himself implants in his chest a device to sustain his damaged heart. Obadiah Stane takes control of Howard’s company, Stark International, and begins weaponizing Stark’s inventions. Tony moves in with family friend James “Rhodey” Rhodes and his mother, Roberta, and begins attending school. There, he meets classmate Pepper Potts who informs Tony that Stane is under investigation by the FBI for possible involvement in Howard’s supposed death. When Tony goes to investigate in his armored battle suit, he ends up preventing a runaway train from crashing into Stark Tower; the media calls him Iron Man. A shadowy figure called the Mandarin, wearing a second mystical Makluan ring, vows to obtain the second ring now in Stane’s possession.
