**Marinette accidentally drops her history textbook while transformed as Ladybug. Alya, who happened to be at the scene, trying to film Ladybug in action, picks up the book, and speculates that Ladybug could be a Parisian coll√©gienne. Marinette starts to panic when she finds out, and by Tikki‚Äôs suggestion, brings Alya to visit a new Pharaoh exhibition at the Louvre, in order to try to get the book back. As they arrive, Alix‚Äôs brother, Jalil Kubdel, is discussing with his father about how one of the exhibitions on display is a resurrection spell. He believes that it could work, and wants to test it out, but Jalil‚Äôs father claims that such an important historical artifact cannot be misused. Frustrated that his father does not believe him, Jalil is influenced by Hawk Moth and transforms into ‚ÄúThe Pharaoh‚Äù with Egyptian god powers who intends to bring back Nefertiti using Alya as a sacrifice. In this episode, we are told that there was a long line of Ladybugs going back over 5,000 years with Marinette being the latest Ladybug.**

**Marinette‚Äôs parents are celebrating their twentieth anniversary, leaving Marinette to take care one of her father‚Äôs special cake requests. However, she gets a call from Alya, who reminds her to bring a banner she made for a race between two of her classmates, Alix and L√™ Chi·∫øn Kim, and she rushes off to Trocad√©ro. Alix has received a family heirloom pocket watch for her fifteenth birthday, and passes it to Alya to safeguard it for her while racing. However, during the race, the watch passes hands multiple times, before it is dropped by Chlo√© onto the ground and skated over by Alix, destroying the watch. Angry at her friends, Alix is attracted to Hawk Moth‚Äôs akuma and turns into ‚ÄúTimebreaker‚Äù, a speedy villain who freezes people and fades from existence with a touch to get energy to travel back through time.**

**Nino develops a crush on Marinette so Adrien offers to help him by asking her out to the¬†zoo. Marinette, however, thinks Adrien is asking her out and happily accepts. When at the zoo, Nino and Marinette are the only ones to show up; Adrien and Alya, at the same time, are hiding out in bushes nearby, helping the two talk to each other by instructing them via earpiece. Meanwhile, Kim mocks the new black panther in the zoo, claiming to the zookeeper and Alya‚Äôs father, Otis, that he can run faster than it. Enraged by his remarks, Otis becomes akumatized by Hawk Moth and mutates into ‚ÄúAniman‚Äù, a villain who can shape-shift into any animal he desires, including extinct species. Afterwards, Nino and Alya find out they share a lot of common things with each other.**
