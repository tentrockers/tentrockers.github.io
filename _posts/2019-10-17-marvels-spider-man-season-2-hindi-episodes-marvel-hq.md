**_It’s now Peter Parker’s “sophomore year” and he’s no longer an inexperienced new superhero nor a brand new student at the intimidating Horizon High. But his foes are also no longer inexperienced and his ever-growing Rogue’s Gallery is now again focused on taking Spider-Man down. Picking up where Season One left off, the stakes are much higher in both Peter’s personal life and super hero life. Peter must balance working at the Daily Bugle to afford tuition at Horizon High with surviving Doc Ock._**
