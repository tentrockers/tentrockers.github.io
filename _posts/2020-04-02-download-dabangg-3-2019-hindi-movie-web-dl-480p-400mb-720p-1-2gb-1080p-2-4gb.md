Starting off again with a heroic antic, the story moves ahead from _Dabangg 2_ with the corrupt yet much-loved cop, ASP Chulbul Pandey (Salman Khan), preventing a robbery at a wedding, and beating the goons and their leader, Gullu, black and blue. Gullu then agrees to return to his former part-time job as a wedding band trumpeter, and Chulbul is seen dealing with the everyday lives of his wife Rajjo (Sonakshi Sinha), brother Makhanchand “Makkhi” Pandey (Arbaaz Khan), also a police officer, and his son, while his father Prajapati Pandey (Pramod Khanna) stays at home with Rajjo. Makkhi appears to be enjoying a lavish lifestyle most of the time.

South star Kiccha Sudeep is playing the role of Balli, the lead antagonist in Dabangg 3. **Salman Khan** took to social media to introduce Kiccha Sudeep as the villain in Dabangg 3.
