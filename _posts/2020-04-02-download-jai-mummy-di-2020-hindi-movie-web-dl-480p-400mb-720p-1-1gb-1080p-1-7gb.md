## Storyline:

_**Jai Mummy Di**_  is a 2020 Indian [Hindi](https://1moviesflix.com?a270777880=bzROVDRheHdpSG1xamJQQ1poa09xMGpqRTdYTEVQZFBUbGxqZkJtcUZnRFl3VGVOd1ZEUWgwSFlndVA0Z1pXYXBtbUtLNjBxbTgvWHRYYVVlNlNVZkJHWkhHaGVnVGNNYlFzR3lmR2JKVkU9 "Hindi")\-language romantic comedy film directed by debutant Navjot Gulati starring Sunny Singh and Sonnalli Seygall. The film also features actors Supriya Pathak and Poonam Dhillon. It was produced by Luv Films and distributed by T-Series. The film tells the story of conflicting dynamics between mothers of protagonists and how that is affecting them and other members of both the families.

Even more heartbreaking is to see two seasoned actors — Dhillon and Pathak — not having much to do onscreen. Considering the film is called Jai Mummy Di, you expect more of the mummies but the whole story is narrated from the point of view of this couple wanting to get married.
