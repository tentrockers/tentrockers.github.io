## Storyline:

All the prisoners of war (POWs) of 1971 Indo-Pak war have been moved to a temporary but heavily fortified prison camp; much to amazement of Maj. Suraj Singh (Manoj Bajpai) and his group of five. Maj. Suraj Singh and his fellow men have yet again fruitlessly tried to break through only to get caught and suffer torture at the hands of their Pakistani counterparts. The group realizes the motives of Pakistani authorities behind gathering all POWs at one place and plan to break free once and for all on the eve of Pakistani independence day.

After a lot of planning the day finally arrives and does not start the way it was intended as one of the bomb fails to explode. The struggle to reach the Indian border begins anyway as these prisoners escape while the Pakistani forces are alerted in the whole region. This struggle too takes its toll as Maj. Suraj Singh watches his fellow soldiers die bravely and honorably at the hands of responsive Pakistani army.
