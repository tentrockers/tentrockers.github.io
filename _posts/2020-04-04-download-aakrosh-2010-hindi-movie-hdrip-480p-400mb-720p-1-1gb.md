## Storyline:

Three friends from Delhi go missing in a small village – Jhanjhar. It’s two months and there is no clue about their disappearance. The media and students movement demand action from the authorities. It’s then that the government orders a Central Bureau of Investigation enquiry with officers Siddhant Chaturvedi (Akshaye Khanna) and Pratap Kumar (Ajay Devgn) to solve the case. They find it difficult to solve the case as the local police and other authorities are a part of Shool Sena, which is supported by the Home Minister and is responsible for illicit activities. Siddhant and Pratap also face Superintendent of police Ajatshatru Singh IPS (Paresh Rawal), a ruthless police officer who misuses his power. Not only that even the locals don’t support the investigation.

It’s with the help of Roshni (Amita Pathak) who is the daughter of the village head and also very wealthy, and Geeta (Bipasha Basu), who is Ajatshatru’s wife and Pratap’s former love, that the investigation moves ahead.

The truth behind the missing three friends is revealed by Geeta who witnessed the killing of these boys by a local politician helped by her husband.
