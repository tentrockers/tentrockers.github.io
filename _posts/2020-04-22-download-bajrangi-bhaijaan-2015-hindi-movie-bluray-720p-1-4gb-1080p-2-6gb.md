## Storyline:

In Sultanpur, a picturesque village in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan, villagers gather to watch a televised cricket match between India and Pakistan. Among them is a pregnant woman Rasia (Meher Vij) who, after giving birth, names her daughter Shahida after Shahid Afridi, the player who wins the game for Pakistan. One afternoon, Shahida (Harshaali Malhotra), now six years old, falls off a cliff as she plays, and is saved by an overhanging tree, but was not able to call for help since she was mute. Since Shahida’s father Rauf, a former Pakistani army man, is unlikely to be granted an Indian visa, a concerned Rasia takes her to the shrine of Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya in Delhi, hoping it will restore Shahida’s speech.

Returning from Delhi, the train stops for repairs just short of the Wagah crossing and Shahida gets off to save a lamb. The train drives off before Shahida can re-board it. Shahida boards a freight train and winds up in Kurukshetra, Haryana. There, she meets Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi alias Bajrangi (Salman Khan), a devout Hindu Brahmin and an ardent devotee of Lord Hanuman. He names her “Munni” and tries in vain to find out where she lives
