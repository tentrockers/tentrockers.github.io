## Storyline:

Dhamaal, as the name suggests, is a fun filled caper about four friends – Deshbandhu Roy aka Roy (Riteish Deshmukh), who believes that he was born to be the best detective in the world; Manav Shrivastav (Javed Jafferey), who actually happens to be the biggest idiot in the world, but is blissfully unaware about it and his elder brother, Aditya Shrivastav aka adi (Arshad Warsi), whose encyclopedic half knowledge about everything only adds to the great expertise of this group; the final component of which is Mr. Scared of everything, Boman Contractor (Aashish Chowdhury), whose greatest fear is his father, Nari Contractor (Asrani). These four lovable idiots live and work together. Their idea of work? Doing small time con jobs! The thought of earning an honest living has never even crossed their minds. So one day while trying to save a dying man, Bose (Prem Chopra), they get their big break. He tells them about hidden millions as he takes his last breath. They are ecstatic! Easy Money! Their life is MADE! Here begins their misfortunes! Police Inspector, Kabir Nayak (Sanjay Dutt) has been chasing Bose for the last ten years. He finally finds him. Only dead! Desperate for his promotion, he questions the suspicious looking foursome he finds next to the body. When they manage to give him the slip, begins the Chase… One misadventure follows after another.
