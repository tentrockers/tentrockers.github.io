## Storyline:

Sidhu(Akshay Kumar) is the lowest on the totem pole, cutting vegetables at road side food stall in Chandni Chowk in Delhi. He longs to escape his dreary existence and looks for shortcuts with astrologers, tarot reader and fake fakirs, basically anything except himself, despite his father figure Dada’s (Mithun Chakravorty) best efforts.

His redeeming moment arrives when two strangers from China claim him as reincarnation of a war hero in the past and take him to china. Sidhu now dreams of wine, women and princely existence in foreign lands. Thanks to the devious translator, a conman by the name Chopstick(Ranvir Shorey), little does he know that he is being taken to the promised land to rid the Chinese village of the vicious smuggler Hojo(Gordon Liu)
