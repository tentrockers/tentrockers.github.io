## Storyline:

All you had enjoyed “Golmaal”.Now come back again with new flavour “Golmaal Returns”. Ajay Devgan, who lives with his wife Kareena Kapoor, sister Amrita Arora and a dumb as same in (Golmaal part -1) brother-in-law Tusshar Kapoor, gets stuck in a yacht after saving an attractive woman Celina Jaitly from some goons. Ajay Devgan knows it’s going to be hard to quell her suspicion so he concocts a cock-and-bull story about having stayed the night with a fictitious friend called Anthony Gonsalves. Ekta refuses to buy his yarn and writes to Anthony (on a fictitious address given to her by Gopal) asking him to visit her. Ajay Devgan convinces his junior at work, a new face in this series “Shreyas Talpade” to pretend to be Anthony.
