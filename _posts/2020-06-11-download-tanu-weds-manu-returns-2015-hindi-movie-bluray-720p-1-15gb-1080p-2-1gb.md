## Storyline:

Tanu goes back to their flat but is lonely and bored. Her friend Payal (Swara Bhaskar) calls her from India and confides that her newborn baby is not actually born of her husband Jassi (Eijaz Khan). Tanu is amused and decides to return to her hometown, Kanpur. Before leaving London, Tanu rings Manu’s buddy Pappi (Deepak Dobriyal) in Delhi and tells him to come to London, to have Manu released from the mental asylum.  
Reaching Kanpur, Tanu lights up the town, having once been its heart-throb. Even Deepak, the local rickshaw-puller, has a crush on her which she indulges. In her parents’ home, Tanu finds a crafty law student, Chintu (Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub), has become a lodger who refuses to pay or leave. Chintu develops a crush on Tanu and she befriends him, going about Kanpur with him. Tanu even dresses in a towel and shocks people meeting her sister for marriage. She visits Raj Awasthi (Jimmy Shergill), her gangster-turned-contractor ex, but he tells her he’s getting engaged to a nice girl soon. Tanu wishes him well and leaves. Chintu snidely tells Raj he is supporting Tanu through her turmoil in the hope of having some fun but Raj cautions him to behave properly.
