## Storyline:

The Mumbai Police Commissioner, Prakash Rathod (Anupam Kher) is going to retire the next day and he recalls the toughest case he had to deal in his career. He gets a call from an anonymous caller (Naseeruddin Shah) on a Wednesday demanding the release of four militants in lieu of information on bombs that the man had planted in various parts of the city. At first, Prakash suspects it to be a prank call but his doubts are dispelled once he actually finds a bomb planted in the police station right opposite his Police Headquarters. He gets a team of his best men together and taps all his resources to track down the man.

Meanwhile, he comes across Naina Roy (Deepal Shaw), a wannabe TV news reporter who also has been tipped off by the anonymous caller. Time passes without any concrete results on the identity of the caller. Ultimately, Prakash gives in to the caller’s demand and puts two of his best men, Arif (Jimmy Shergill) and Jai (Amir Bashir) to hand over the four militants at the Juhu Aviation Base Strip as demanded by the caller.
