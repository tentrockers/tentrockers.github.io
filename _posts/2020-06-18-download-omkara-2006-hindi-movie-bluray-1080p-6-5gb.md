## Storyline:

Omkara ‘Omi’ Shakula (Ajay Devgan) heads a gang of outlaws supporting the local politician Tiwar Bhaisaab (Naseerudin Shah). Omi’s most trusted lieutenants are Ishwar ‘Langda’ Tyagi (Saif Ali Khan) and Keshwar ‘Kesu Firangi’ Upadhayay (Vivek Oberoi). The film opens with Langda attacking a marriage procession. He convinces the bridegroom Raju (Deepak Dobriyal) to chase after the bride, Dolly (Kareena Kapoor), who has been kidnapped by Omi. Raju, however, fails and wedding doesn’t take place.

Dolly’s father (Kamal Tiwari), a high-profile lawyer Ragunath Mishra, angrily storms Omi’s place and demands the return of his daughter. Omi, however, claims that Dolly chose to be with him rather than Raju. Bhaisaab smooths the situation over by having Dolly tell her father that she consented to elope with Omi and was not violently abducted. Mishra feels humiliated and betrayed, leaving his daughter with Omi.
