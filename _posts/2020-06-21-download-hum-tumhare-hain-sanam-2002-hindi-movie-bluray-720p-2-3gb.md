Gopal Kishan (Shahrukh Khan) is a wealthy Business tycoon. He is deeply in love with his childhood friend Radha (Madhuri Dixit). Gopal and Radha get married. Gopal always shows love to his wife, but she does not seem to love him in return.

As much as he loves Radha, Gopal cannot stand her younger brother Prashant (Atul Aghnihotri) who depends on them financially. Gopal gets even more annoyed that his wife is always talking on the phone to her childhood friend Suraj (Salman Khan), who is a raising singer. Gopal starts suspecting that Radha is having an affair with Suraj and is extremely jealous.

Gopal soon throws Radha out of the house and later gives her a letter of divorce, which leaves her heartbroken. Suraj is appalled that this has been done to his childhood friend and arranges to meet Gopal in order to try and persuade him that he has done wrong. Gopal brings a loaded gun to this meeting. In the meeting, Gopal blames Suraj for the problems between him and Radha – Suraj now feels guilty and promises to stay away from Radha for good.
