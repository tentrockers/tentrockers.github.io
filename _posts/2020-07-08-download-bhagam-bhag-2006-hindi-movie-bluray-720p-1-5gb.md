## Storyline:

Champak Chaturvedi (Paresh Rawal) the director of a theater group, is offered a chance to perform a show in London. Babla (Govinda) and Bunty (Akshay Kumar) are two derps and flirts in his group, always fighting with each other to get the role of the hero. Their behavior causes the actress (Tanushree Dutta) to run away. This really upsets the organizer, who offered the chance mainly because of the heroine. After reaching London, Champak tells the duo that whoever gets a new actress will get to become hero. Then Babla asks Gulab Singh Lakhan Singh Haryanewale (Rajpal Yadav), a local driver where he can find a heroine. Gulab Singh misinterprets this as prostitute and directs him to a park.

Bunty, who has heard everything, follows them. In a misunderstanding, they meet two men from underworld and exchange their goods, only to find that the men have sold drugs to them since the underworld misinterpreted their need for heroine as “heroin”. Bunty convinces Babla into going to the police to turn in the drugs to get good credit or an award, but the police get the wrong impression and think they are drug dealers. Commissioner JD Mehra (Jackie Shroff) releases them after telling them not to leave the country until they are proven innocent. Then while search of a heroine, Bunty and Gulab Singh take help of Guru (Shakti Kapoor), a local don who is a drunkard and they end up breaking his (Guru’s) legs. Guru sends his goons to thrash Bunty and Gulab Singh but they escape. They bump into Munni (Lara Dutta), who is trying to commit suicide. Bunty saves her and brings her to the theatre group to be the heroine.
