**“Superman” (not to be confused with the American superhero Superman), later “Birdman”, gives a clumsy human boy, Mitsuo Suwa, three items to help him as Perman, Superman/Birdman’s apprentice:  
****  
A helmet which multiplies the wearer’s physical strength by 6600 and the ability for the wearer to have the power of omnilingualism by spinning the ear part of the helmet,  
A cape that allows the wearer to fly at a speed of 119 km/h and run with great speed,  
A badge which enables the wearer to communicate with other Permen and to breathe underwater and in space.  
In addition, he gives him a copy-robot which transforms into an identical clone to help him keep his secret identity during missions. However, if his secret identity becomes known to others, his brain will be destroyed for betraying the secret of Perman. This penalty is reduced to being turned into an animal in later chapters of the manga and in the anime.  
  
Mitsuo begins by rescuing people who are victims of crimes or disasters, so as Perman he is admired. He is, however, often troubled by his dual life as a both brilliant superhero and as an unrewarded ordinary boy. He wishes to abandon his role as Perman, but he continues to be Perman out of a desire to help people caught in disasters.  
  
Soon, he meets other Permen and teams with them. The other Permen are:  
  
Perman 2: A chimpanzee named Booby  
Perman 3: A girl named Perko/Sumire Hoshino  
Perman 4: A boy named Peryan/Hozen Oyama  
In the end of the original story, he achieves the status of Superman and leaves to a planet for Supermen to become a superhero team. In the TV series, he stays on earth his whole life.**
